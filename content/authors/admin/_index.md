I am currently a Data Scientist at Tangerine Bank, an online and mobile banking company. My interests include developing elegant solutions to solve problems using data and analytics. In my role I am involved in developing predictive models to drive acquisition and pricing optimization at Tangerine.

Prior to transitioning to Data Science, my Ph.D research revolved around exploring human memory and perception.
